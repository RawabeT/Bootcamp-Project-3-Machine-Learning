# Bootcamp-Project-3-Machine-Learning

Based on what you’ve learned until now, use numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn to create a project of your choosing. This project must at least satisfy the following minimum requirements:

- Choose a public dataset that needs to clean and preprocess. ✅
- EDA
  - Apply the essential EDA steps: head, shape, info, describe, missing values ✅
  - Display different charts that give an overview of  your data. ✅
- Use two splitting methods (train-test split and cross-validation split). ✅
- Choose three proper ML Algorithms. ✅
- Report appropriate evaluation metrics for each model. ✅
- Create a chart that compares the final results of your selected models. 
- Write a final conclusion and recommendations (your interpretation of the results).
- Report your final conclusion and findings in one page (readme markdown file).
  - Team members.

    - About Dataset
Historically gold coinage was widely used as currency; when paper money was introduced, it typically was a receipt redeemable for gold coin or bullion. In a monetary system known as the gold standard, a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency. For a long period, the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one troy ounce was equal to $20.67 ($0.665 per gram), but in 1934 the dollar was devalued to $35.00 per troy ounce ($0.889/g). By 1961, it was becoming hard to maintain this price, and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand.

  - A table represents the final results of ML models.
- **[Nice to have - Optional]** Create an interactive dashboard using plotly.
- Due Date: Sun, 13 Nov, at 12:00 p.m.
- The Final presentation will be on Sunday (10 min for each group).

### Final Deliverables:
- Notebook file(.ipynb).
- Dataset file.
- README.md file.
